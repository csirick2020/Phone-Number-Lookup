## **Phone Number Lookup**

</div>

This is a very simple implementation of [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/)'s [Lookup API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/lookup/v2-api) that allows you to find details about U.S. phone numbers.  

*You will need to have an active Twilio account (the free version is fine until you run out of trial credits).
